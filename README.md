Do you want to be part of a digital transformation for one of the world’s most stylish hospitality companies?

Do you want to be in a friendly, team-orientated culture working in one of the most sophisticated and elaborate parts of London?

# I’m die hard Ruby fan. What will I be doing? 

As a hot shot Ruby hire, you will join the team working on building a central platform that underpins all aspects of their business operations including, bookings, payments, membership renewals, the creation of a social network for their member base as well as integration with key POS systems used by the restaurants and hotels they manage. Digital transformations are exciting to be part of as there is a lot of work to be done and it will give you the chance to not only enhance your skills but be a part of revolutionary change within one of the hottest hospitality companies across the globe. 


# Sounds intriguing! Luxurious Hospitality you say… how suave are we talking?

An international hospitality business who own some of the most exclusive membership clubs in London, New York and Barcelona. Three of the world’s most vibrant and prevalent cities! The business also owns a number of boutique hotels and some of the most popular restaurants and cocktail bars in the locations in which they operate. 25 years of operating as a traditional hospitality business before beginning a program of digital transformation around two years ago.


# Ok that does sound pretty cool. What is the team’s vibe saying?

Based in Soho the development team work from the brands headquarters and one of their flagship clubs. Pretty sick right? There are currently about 15 people in technology with Ruby being the primary development skill however they also use JavaScript, Vue.JS, Node.JS and have plans to expand into native mobile development. The vibe is very friendly-orientated, and there will always be a helping hand if you have any questions or get stuck. You will be nurtured and guided to be the best developer you can be. Plus, you’ll be working with some pretty cool individuals on an interesting technical project in the centre of Soho…I mean that does sound like the dream if you ask me. 


# Very dreamy indeed! What type of projects could I be working on?
* Integration of existing POS systems into the new central platform.
* Building payment API’s to connect with a variety of different payment gateways.
* Building mobile native mobile applications (Swift and Android).
* Creation of a social network for business for use by their members.


# Yes, yes and YES! I’m so down! Do I need a particular set of skills? 

Strong Ruby development experience is ideal, but the team are open to recruiting developers from other backgrounds e.g. if you have a computer science degree that greats but if you don’t and you’ve completed a coding course then that’s fabulous too! As long as you’re pragmatic and have a “full stack mentality” you’ll fit it in just fine. You will need to have an interest in understanding the business domain with a view to basing technical decisions on improving the experience of the customer.
